# CaNARY

Welcome to the CaNARY repository! The CaNARY code is a publicly available, simple, fast, Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code. Its aim is to obtain luminosity estimates for emission lines that are part of a blend, in the context of nebular supernova spectra. The code tries to be as fast as possible, while still simulating the relevant physics.

The code was first presented in "Formation and Diagnostic Use of Carbon Lines in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae", Barmentloo &amp; Jerkstrand, 2025.
In this work, we use the code to obtain luminosity estimates for the [C I] 8727 line, which is part of the complex Ca NIR blend. 

At the time of writing (10-09-2025), this repository contains the code in the form in which it was used in this first paper.
We hope to generalise the code and add detialed instructions in **the upcoming weeks** , so that once done, a user can simply pick their favorite blend and obtain luminosity estimates for their favorite line. Stay tuned!

In case you want to use the code and questions show up, feel free to send an email to stan.barmentloo@astro.su.se
